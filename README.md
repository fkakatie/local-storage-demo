# Populate a Simple Guestbook with Local Storage

This tutorial is intended to show how local storage can be used to store one or many guests, how those guests can be retrieved from local storage, and how those guests can be cleared from local storage. The guests in local storage will be displayed to the screen.

## Add One Guest to Local Storage

The [`script-addOne.js`](https://github.com/fkakatie/local-storage-demo/blob/master/assets/js/script-addOne.js) file includes functionality for storing, retrieving, and removing _one_ guest to and from local storage. 

## Add Many Guests to Local Storage

The [`script-addMany.js`](https://github.com/fkakatie/local-storage-demo/blob/master/assets/js/script-addMany.js) file includes functionality for storing, retrieving, and removing _many_ guests to and from local storage.

## Do It Yourself!

The [`script.js`](https://github.com/fkakatie/local-storage-demo/blob/master/assets/js/script.js) file is devoid of local storage functionality &mdash; and is waiting for you to write it! Try completing the functions in the file to add one guest, then many guests to local storage!
